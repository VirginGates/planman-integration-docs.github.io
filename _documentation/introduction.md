  This documentation provides a guide for integrating and working with the Planman REST API. After successful integration, you can utilize Planman's on-demand delivery management system along with all its unique features.
  
  Planman API provides you with the ability to request a delivery for your order and have that order delivered by one of our affiliated operators.
  To learn more about our rates and start the integration process, please contact one of our affiliated operators iFleet or Scooter.
