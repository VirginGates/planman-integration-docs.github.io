  To get you started, the Planman team will create a branch entity for each of your branches. Each branch will have a unique code that can be used for authentication. The branch codes will be provided to you by our affilated operator.
  
  Furthermore, each branch serves a variety of zones based on different pricing rates.

  The production API base URL will be provided to you by our team after successful integration. 

  You can test your integration with Planman on our staging environment before deploying to production.
