  To get you started, the Planman team will create a branch entity for each of your branches. Each branch will have a unique code that can be used for authentication.
  
  Furthermore, each branch will be assigned to a certain delivery hub, where each hub serves a variety of zones. In other words, each hub can deliver orders to those specific zones.
