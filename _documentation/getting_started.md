  To get you started, the Planman team will create a branch entity for each of your branches. Each branch will have a unique code that can be used for authentication. The branch codes will be provided to you by the Planman team.
  
  Furthermore, each branch serves a variety of zones based on different pricing rates.

  You can test your integration with Planman on our staging environment before deploying to production.
