  To get you started, the Planman team will create a branch entity for each of your branches. Each branch will have a unique code that can be used for authentication. The branch codes will be provided to you by the Planman team.
  
  Furthermore, each branch serves a variety of delivery zones based on different rates. In other words, each branch can deliver orders to those specific zones.

  You can test your integration with Planman on our staging environment before deploying to production.
